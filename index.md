# Wild Boars
`By Kristin Wickline`

## Geographic Range
Wild boars (*Sus scrofa*) are a cosmopolitan species. They originated in Europe and Asia, but were widely introduced to North America and are considered an invasive species in the southeastern United States and California. They are common throughout Eurasia, and inhabit every continent except Antarctica.

## Physical Description
Wild boars range from 153 to 240 cm in total length and weigh 66 to 272 kg as adults. Females tend to be smaller than males of the same age, with the size difference becoming more apparent as the animals age. Adult wild boars have a thick, coarse coat of hair covering their bodies. Their coat ranges in color from black to brownish-red to white. Depending on their geographic location, they can have a speckled or solid pelage color. They may also have longer bristly hairs that grow down the middle of their backs. At birth, young boars generally have yellowish-brown stripes running down their backs that disappear into an even coloration within about 4 months. Wild boars can stand as tall as 0.9 m at their bulky shoulders, tapering off towards their hind quarters. Their tails measure 21 to 38 cm, and their ears are 24 to 26 cm long. Their upper canine teeth typically measure 5 to 10 cm and are generally larger than their lower canines. Their upper canines are usually visible even when their mouth is closed. Their dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 3/3 = 44.
